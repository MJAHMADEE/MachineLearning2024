# Support Vector Machines (SVM) Implementations

ðŸŒŸ Welcome to our repository dedicated to exploring Support Vector Machines (SVM) for educational purposes in our Machine Learning course. ðŸŒŸ This repository aims to provide comprehensive resources for understanding SVM through practical examples and custom implementations.

## Overview

In this repository, we offer two main types of SVM implementations:

1. **SVM with scikit-learn**: Leverage the robust scikit-learn library to swiftly implement standard SVM models.
2. **SVM from Scratch**: Dive deep into the workings of SVM by constructing models from the ground up, fostering a profound comprehension of the underlying principles.

## Features

We delve into various scenarios and advanced topics in SVM, including:

- **Kernel SVMs**: Experiment with different kernels like linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF) to grasp their impact on SVM decision boundaries.
- **Multiclass Classification**: Extend SVM's binary classification capability to handle multiple classes, essential for tackling complex datasets.

# SVM Implementations and Demonstrations
