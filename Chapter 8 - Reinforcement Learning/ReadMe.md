## Overview

In this repository, we offer implementations of various Reinforcement Learning techniques:

1. **Q-learning**: Understand and implement Q-learning, a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the value of an action in a particular state.

2. **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**: Explore DQN, which combines Q-learning with deep neural networks, allowing the agent to learn policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs.

3. **Double DQN (DDQN)**: Dive into DDQN, an enhancement over DQN that addresses the overestimation bias by decoupling the selection and evaluation of actions.

4. **Policy Gradient Methods**: Implement policy gradient methods, which optimize the policy directly by maximizing the expected reward.

5. **Actor-Critic Methods**: Explore actor-critic methods, which combine the benefits of value-based and policy-based approaches in reinforcement learning.

6. **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: Implement PPO, a robust and scalable policy gradient method that ensures reliable and efficient training.

## Features

We delve into various scenarios and advanced topics in Reinforcement Learning, including:

- **Simulation Environments**: Learn how to set up and use simulation environments for testing and evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms.

- **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: Understand the trade-off between exploration and exploitation in reinforcement learning and how to balance them effectively.

- **Reward Shaping**: Explore techniques for reward shaping to accelerate learning by providing additional feedback to the agent.
